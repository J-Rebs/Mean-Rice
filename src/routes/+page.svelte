<h2>Client-Console</h2>

<h3>To learn more about how we made this see <a href="/about">here</a></h3>

<p>
  This is a demo-client. This is not full functionality. We have provided
  several possible layouts the client could make use of if it wanted to build a
  further level of logins for end users.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/admin">Admin layout</a></li>
  <li><a href="/listener">Listener layout</a></li>
</ul>
